#Robots Communication Simulation

We design Simulation thet presents an arena of robots.
the arena defined size 1000 * 1000 , There are white , black and gray area and the rest is white .

  * in the white (light) area : Robots can move freely , and the Robot battery cherging . 
  * in the gray (dark) area   : Robots can pass through but they lose some present of they battery .
  * in the black area         : Robots can not pass through .

There Robots non-moving (static) and Robots moving (non-static), static robots know the location of the lot but of moving robots do not know. The purpose of robots movable discover the location estimated using robots Stats Posts
to help the robots in the gray area to reach light in order to increase there battery life. 

Robot can send and receive message , This helps them to communicate with each other 
reach light in order to increase there battery life. 


#### The purpose of the project is : 
robots movable discover the location estimated using robots Stats Posts .
